# Skupper Operator

Skupper operator that simply produces the bundle and the index images.
Its goal is to avoid introducing a new CRD, just relying on the site-controller
to kick things off based on an existing skupper-site ConfigMap.

# Installing the skupper-operator


The instructions below demonstrates how to install the skupper-operator
and run it inside the `my-namespace` namespace. If you want to install it in
a different namespace, edit the referenced yaml before applying.

If you want to test your catalog against a local minikube cluster,
you'll need to install OLM first. For more info, check this out:
https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/getting-started/

In an OpenShift cluster, OLM is already installed. So you just need to 
create your CatalogSource.


## Installing on Minikube

To install the CatalogSource in your Minikube cluster, assuming  that
the OLM is installed (0.17.0+), run:

```
# Creating a CatalogSource in the olm namespace
kubectl apply -f examples/k8s/00-cs.yaml

# Wait for the skupper-operator catalog pod to be running
kubectl -n olm get pods | grep skupper-operator

# Create an OperatorGroup in the `my-namespace` namespace
kubectl apply -f examples/k8s/10-og.yaml

# Create a Subscription in the `my-namespace` namespace
kubectl apply -f examples/k8s/20-sub.yaml
```

## Installing on OpenShift

```
# Creating a CatalogSource in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace
kubectl apply -f examples/ocp/00-cs.yaml

# Wait for the skupper-operator catalog pod to be running
kubectl -n openshift-marketplace get pods | grep skupper-operator

# Create an OperatorGroup in the `my-namespace` namespace
kubectl apply -f examples/ocp/10-og.yaml

# Create a Subscription in the `my-namespace` namespace
kubectl apply -f examples/ocp/20-sub.yaml
```

## Validate skupper-operator is running

Look at the pods running in your `my-namespace` namespace now. You should 
see a running pod for the `skupper-site-controller`.

```
kubectl -n my-namespace get pods
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
skupper-site-controller-d7b57964-gxms6   1/1     Running   0          39m
```

Now the Skupper Operator is running and you can create a site. 
At this point with most Operators, you would create a CR, however 
the Skupper Operator manages your
Skupper site by watching a `ConfigMap` named exclusively `skupper-site`
in the namespace where it is running (in this case the `my-namespace` namespace).

# Creating a new skupper site

Create a `ConfigMap` named `skupper-site` in the `my-namespace` namespace:

```
kubectl apply -f examples/skupper-site-interior.yaml
```

Once the `ConfigMap` is created, Skupper Site Controller will initialize
your Skupper site and you can verify everything is running properly if you
see the `skupper-router` and the `skupper-service-controller` pods running
in the `my-namespace` namespace, in example:

```
kubectl -n my-namespace get pods
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
skupper-router-8c6cc6d76-27562                1/1     Running   0          40s
skupper-service-controller-57cdbb56c5-vc7s2   1/1     Running   0          34s
skupper-site-controller-d7b57964-gxms6        1/1     Running   0          51m
```

You can now navigate to the Skupper console.

```
$ skupper -n <namespace> status
```

The namespace in the example YAML is `my-namespace`.

Navigate to the `skupper` route and log in using the credentials you specified in YAML. The example YAML uses `admin/changeme`.

# Uninstalling

## Uninstalling from Minikube

```
# Delete the skupper-site ConfigMap
kubectl delete -f examples/skupper-site-interior.yaml

# Deleting the Subscription
kubectl delete -f examples/k8s/20-sub.yaml

# Delete the CSV
kubectl -n my-namespace delete csv skupper-operator.v1.4.3

# Deleting the OperatorGroup
kubectl delete -f examples/k8s/10-og.yaml

# Deleting the CatalogSource
kubectl delete -f examples/k8s/00-cs.yaml
```

## Uninstalling from OpenShift

```
# Delete the skupper-site ConfigMap
kubectl delete -f examples/skupper-site-interior.yaml

# Deleting the Subscription
kubectl delete -f examples/ocp/20-sub.yaml

# Delete the CSV
kubectl -n my-namespace delete csv skupper-operator.v1.4.3

# Deleting the OperatorGroup
kubectl delete -f examples/ocp/10-og.yaml

# Deleting the CatalogSource
kubectl delete -f examples/ocp/00-cs.yaml
```

# Note for cluster-wide installations

If you want to try a cluster-wide installation, you don't need
to create the `OperatorGroup` as it is already defined at the
destination namespaces, so you just need to create the subscription
at the correct namespaces, see below.

## Cluster-wide installation on Minikube

On Minikube the `Subscription` needs to be defined in the `operators` namespace, like:

```
kubectl apply -f examples/k8s/20-sub-cluster-wide.yaml
```

## Cluster-wide installation on OpenShift

On OpenShift the `Subscription` needs to be defined in the `openshift-operators` namespace, like:

```
kubectl apply -f examples/ocp/20-sub-cluster-wide.yaml
```

# Building the bundle and index images

To build the bundle and index images, you just need to run: `make`.
